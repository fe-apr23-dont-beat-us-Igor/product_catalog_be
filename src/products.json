Apple released the Apple Watch on April 24, 2015.Apple initially designed the watch to replace phones and reduce the time users spend looking at phone screens. However, the Apple Watch became popular in part for its innovations in fitness tracking and health monitoring, as well as its ability to be used with internet of things (IoT) devices.Since its release, the Apple Watch has added several new features, including water resistance, blood oxygen and electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, a body temperature sensor and an emergency SOS that can detect when a user falls or has some other accident and contact emergency services. The watches can be synced with a user's iPhone, Mac laptop and AirPods. Apple Watches accounted for 43% of smartwatch shipments in the fourth quarter of 2022, dominating that market, according to research firm Counterpoint.",
